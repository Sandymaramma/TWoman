                for promoting menstrual health, reducing stigma and

              <h4>WHAT REALLY HAPPENS DURING MENOPAUSE?</h4>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Menopause is a natural biological process that occurs in women,
            typically between the ages of 45 and 55, although the onset can
            vary. It marks the end of a woman's menstrual cycles and
            reproductive capacity. Menopause is considered to have occurred when
            a woman has not had a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months.
            The transitional phase leading up to menopause is known as
            perimenopause, during which a woman may experience irregular
            menstrual cycles and various symptoms due to fluctuating hormone
            levels.

              <h4>DECODING MENOPAUSE SYMPTOMS</h4>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Common symptoms associated with menopause include hot flashes, night
            sweats, vaginal dryness, mood swings, insomnia, fatigue, weight
            gain, and changes in libido. Also, menopausal women may experience
            bone density loss, increasing the risk of osteoporosis, and
            cardiovascular changes due to the decrease in estrogen levels. While
            menopause is a natural and inevitable phase of a woman's life, its
            symptoms can vary widely in severity and duration.

              <h4>NAVIGATING MENOPAUSE WITH CONFIDENCE</h4>

          </div>

          <p>
            It's important to note that menopause is a natural process and not a
            disease. However, it can significantly impact a woman's physical,
            emotional, and psychological well-being. Therefore, understanding
            and support from healthcare providers, family, and friends are
            crucial during this life transition.
